This is my Cache Simulator project from my Computer Architecture class in Spring 2019.

The goal was to implement a simple cache simulator in Java using an LRU and a FIFO replacement policy.

## Running the simulator

java -jar SIM.jar \<CACHE_SIZE\> \<ASSOC\> \<REPLACEMENT\> \<WB\> \<TRACE_FILE\>
  
1. CACHE_SIZE = Size of the cache, such as 8 for 8KB or 128 for 128KB.
2. ASSOC = Associativity of the cache, such as 4.
3. REPLACEMENT = Either Least Recently Used (LRU) or First in First Out (FIFO)
4. WB = Either Write-Back or Write-Through
5. TRACE_FILE = The file with the commands for the cache simulator
