## Description 

This project is a simple visualization of several sorting algorithms in JavaScript. The sorting algorithms included are:

- BubbleSort
- SelectionSort
- InsertionSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- HeapSort

The visualization allows you to see the sorting algorithms in action and adjust the speed of the visualization and the number of elements to sort.

## Live Demo

The live <a href="/demos/sorting">demo</a> is available to try out. It provides a simple interface to visualize the sorting algorithms in action. You can adjust the speed of the visualization and the number of elements to sort. Be sure to restart the visualization after changing the speed or number of elements.
