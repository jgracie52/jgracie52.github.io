# Realtime Face/Edge Detection

## Description

Built a real-time face detection/recognition command line program using OpenCV. Also implemented a near real-time canny edge detector using the same system. 

## Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* Numpy
* Pandas

## Face Detection

Face detection is done using the Haar Cascade Classifier. The classifier is trained on a dataset of faces and is able to detect faces in real time. The classifier is implemented in the `face_detection.py` file.

## Face Recognition

Face recognition is achieved using a Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) classifier using images captured from the system and cropped using the face detector. The classifier is implemented in the `face_recognition.py` file.

### Edge Detection

Edge detection is done using the Canny Edge Detector. The detector is implemented in the `edge_detection.py` file.

### How to Use
To use the program, first open main.py and adjust settings as desired. From there, run main.py and read
given options from the system:

Options:

1. Detect Faces (No recognition)
2. Add User to Recognizer
3. Retrain Faces
4. Recognize Faces
5. Detect Edges
6. Quit


Select option 1 to just detect faces without reconition
Select option 2 to add a user's face to the reconizer
Select option 3 to retrain all faces in db.csv
Select Option 4 to perform recognition
Select option 5 for edge detection
Select option 6 to quit

---
***Notes***

* Press q during any video capture to end the capture and return to the options menu
* A user may already be in the database file with the same face. If so, remove them from db.csv and delete their dataset folder. Then run option 2
* If there are no users in db.csv, or the trainer.yml file is missing, this will not work
---

## Future Work

* Add a GUI
* Add a database to store user information
* Add a way to remove users from the database
* Add a way to update user information
* Add a way to update user images
