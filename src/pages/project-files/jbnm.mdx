## Description

Josh's Better NetworkMiner (JBNM) is an extension to Netresec's Opensource NetworkMiner computer forensics tool. 

JBNM adds new quality of life improvements including:

- The ability to load multiple capture files at once (instead of one at a time)
- New Case Files columns to show what case file a packet came from when viewing the data tables
- The ability to export all data tables to a single Excel workbook

## Usage

JBNM is a standalone executable that can be run from anywhere. It does not need to be installed.

To use JBNM, simply run the executable and select the capture files you wish to load. You can select multiple files at once by holding down the `Ctrl` key while selecting files.

Once the capture files have been loaded, you can view the data tables by clicking on the tabs at the top of the window. You can also export the data tables to a single Excel workbook by clicking the `Export` button.

## Download

You can download the latest version of JBNM from the [releases page](https://github.com/jgracie52/joshs-better-network-miner/releases/latest).

## Credits

JBNM was created by Josh Gracie. 

JBNM is based on the [NetworkMiner](https://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner) computer forensics tool by Netresec.

JBNM uses the [ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) library to export data tables to Excel.
